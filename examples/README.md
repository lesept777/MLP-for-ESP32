# Examples
The 5 first examples use SIGMOID activation function and quadratic cost function.

## MLP_Sinus
Begin with this simple example: it automatically fits a sine curve

## MLP_Sinus2
Same objective but with a user's made optimization function

## MLP_HighLow
Classify 2D points above or below a sine curve

Shows how to improve the results by doing several optimization processes

## MLP_Circles
Classify 2D points inside 3 circles

## MLP_4Sectors
Classify 2D points in 4 square sectors, the last activation function is SIGMOID

## MLP_4Sectors_Softmax
Same classification using SOFTMAX activation function and cross entropy cost function

## MLP_BostonHousing
Shows how to read a dataset in a csv file

## MLP_Iris
The well-known ML test: predict the class of Iris plant (0 = Iris Setosa, 1 = Iris Versicolour, 2 = Iris Virginica) as a function of sepal and petal dimensions

## MLP_Breast_Cancer
An example of a large number of features (30)

## MLP_Mines
An example of a large dataset
