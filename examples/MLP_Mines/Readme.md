# Sonar imagery: detection of Mines vs. Rocks

This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network.  The
task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.
